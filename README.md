#  Real-time Data Processing with Streamlit and AWS Kinesis:This project aims to build a real-time data processing pipeline using Streamlit and AWS Kinesis. The project will read streaming data from the Kinesis stream, perform some data transformation using Streamlit, and then store the data to a database. This project can be useful in building data-driven applications such as real-time dashboards, fraud detection, and predictive analytics.
